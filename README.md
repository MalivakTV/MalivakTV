- 👋 Hi, I’m Brad Lund who once upon a time streamed as @MalivakTV on Twitch (RPGs, games etc)
- 👀 I'm back to school finishing my math degree to add to my physics one with an eye on CS courses along the way
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C, Matlab to support my math courses and to become a better coder
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects involving math at levels I can understand (Calculus, Discrete, Linear Algebra, Diff EQ, Complex Analysis)
- 📫 Reach me at brad@malivaktv.com
